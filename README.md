# Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of **sentiment analysis**, a common application in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal is to classify text into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments using machine learning techniques.

---

## Purpose

1. To provide a hands-on tutorial for performing sentiment analysis using machine learning and NLP techniques.
2. To preprocess textual data for effective machine learning.
3. To train and evaluate models for sentiment classification.
4. To visualize results to gain deeper insights into data and model performance.

## Applications

- **E-commerce**: Analyze customer reviews to improve product quality.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Understand public sentiment toward brands or events.
- **Customer Support**: Detect dissatisfaction to enhance service.

## Steps in the Pipeline

### **1. Loading and Exploring the Dataset**
- **Dataset**: The NLTK **Movie Reviews Dataset**, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
- **Objective**: Understand the structure of the dataset and identify cleaning requirements.

### **2. Text Preprocessing**
- Convert text to lowercase for consistency.
- Remove punctuation and stop words (common words like "the" and "is").
- Tokenize sentences into words.
- Perform stemming to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").

### **3. Feature Extraction Using TF-IDF**
- Use **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to transform text into numerical features.
- TF-IDF emphasizes significant words while reducing the weight of commonly occurring terms.

### **4. Model Training**
- Train a **Naive Bayes Classifier** on the TF-IDF features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Metrics Used:
  - **Accuracy**: Measures overall model performance.
  - **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**: Detailed evaluation for each class.
- Visualize errors using a **confusion matrix**.

### **6. Word Cloud Visualization**
- Generate word clouds for **positive** and **negative** reviews to highlight frequently used words for each sentiment.

## Results and Insights

### **Key Insights**
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Improved data quality and ensured meaningful feature extraction.
2. **Model Performance**: The Naive Bayes classifier achieved high accuracy, effectively distinguishing positive and negative sentiments.
3. **Visualization**: Word clouds highlighted key terms associated with each sentiment.

### **Applications**
- Monitor customer reviews to improve products.
- Analyze social media sentiment to manage brand reputation.
- Detect dissatisfaction in customer support.
